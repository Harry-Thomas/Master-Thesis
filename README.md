The models for predicting the measured enzyme activity of the protein sequences as 
explained in sections 5.1,5.2 and 5.3 was programmed in Python (version 3.8) using 
Spyder API. The program is split into three different functional modules where 
each module handles the specific functionality. The modules include the code for 
developing the three models as described in the design.

The theoretical basis of the Transfer Learning methodology and python 
codes to compute the enzyme activity of protein sequences are presented. The 
input data set consisting of the protein sequences and corresponding sequence 
factor values was obtained from ZHAW Biocataylsis laboratory, led by Prof. Rebecca 
Buller. The concept of Transfer Learning is of high importance in machine learning. 
It is considered as one of the Machine Learning success drivers in implementations 
based on deep learning models in todayâ€™s world. The focus of this thesis is to study 
and understand the Transfer Learning concept and use this to generate a new deep 
learning model that has been developed from a model learnt with bigger datasets 
that can be utilised for learning over the unseen new smaller datasets .The
developed code for computing the performance of transfer learned model has been
implemented in Python. The generated data set obtained from ZHAW repository
contains over 290 protein sequences associated with 553 feature values to be 
learnt. To enable users to understand the models, Python scripts are provided and 
can be used for the generation model performance parameters as well. Transfer
Learning has been demonstrated to show that it helps in increasing the overall 
accuracy of the machine learning models.

The input dataset is made private as its confidential property of the project.
